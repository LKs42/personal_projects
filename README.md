# personal_projects
This repository is all about side projects I do in my free time. As for the rest of my work, it is mostly centered around game development.

# What you'll find
Ready-to-play java games, but also various javascript experimentations (see **p5_curiosities** for more). It is my ambition to feed this repository as I learn and grow as a developer.
