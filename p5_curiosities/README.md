# A few p5 curiosities
This folder contains a selection of interesting p5 experimentations centered around gamedev. 

# What is p5 ? 
p5.js is, according to its developers, "a JavaScript library for creative coding, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else." 
I like to use this framework to create quick and interesting code concepts on the go. It is also very light, so I've elected to include it in this repository, so that you may experience it as soon as your clone the repo.

# How to use
- Clone the current repository 
- Click on any of the HTML files
- Try stuff out !
